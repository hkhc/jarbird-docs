In this tutorial, we will go through the process of publishing to Maven Central.

The sample project is [here](https://github.com/hkhc/jarbird-samples/tree/master/mavencentral).

We need the following before we can publish components to Maven Central.

- JIRA account for Sonatype OSSRH (OSS Repository Hosting)
- Claim your namespace on Maven Central repository

Refer to [official documentation](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-guide/#initial-setup) of OSSRH to set up the above.

If your project is hosted at GitHub, and use `io.github.[user]` or `com.github.[user]` as group name, then you don't need to claim your namespace.

Again they are one-off things, If you have done that you may go ahead.

## Project setup

### gradle.properties

Add the OSSRH account information to `gradle.properties`.

```properties title="~/.gradle/gradle.properties"
# ...
repository.mavencentral.username=your-username
repository.mavencentral.password=your-password
repository.mavencentral.newUser=false
# ...
```

Note the `newUser` line. Maven Central use different servers to publish and manage publication depends on whether the account is a 'new' account. If the account is registered before Feb 2021, it is an 'old' account.

Jarbird adjusts the URL to publish components according to the `newUser` flag. Default is `true`.

### build.gradle

Tell Jarbird plugin that we want to publish to Maven Central.

<!--tabs-->
# build.gradle
```groovy {4}
// ...
jarbird {
    pub {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
// ...
```
# build.gradle.kts
```kotlin {4}
// ...
jarbird {
    pub {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
// ...
```
<!--/tabs-->

### pom.yaml

It is required to provide sufficient information about the component before it is approved to be published. This information includes:

- The proper GAV coordinate.
- Description
- URL that hosts the source code
- Developer's information.

Refer to Sonatype [page](https://central.sonatype.org/pages/requirements.html#sufficient-metadata) for detailed requirements of POM to publish component to Maven Central.

Jarbird get all of those at the `pom.yaml` file:

``` yaml title="pom.yaml"
group: jarbirdsamples
artifactId: mevendemo
version: 1.0
packaging: jar

licenses:
  - name: Apache-2.0
    dist: repo

developers:
  - id: demo
    name: Jarbird Demo
    email: jarbird.demo@fake-email.com

scm:
  repoType: github.com
  repoName: demo/jarbird-samples/maven-demo

```

See [reference](../reference/pom) for more details about the content of `pom.yaml`.

Jarbird plugin read the file and create a proper POM file for publishing automatically.

With this setup, we can see more tasks available with `./gradlew tasks`

```text
Jarbird publishing tasks
------------------------
jbPublish - Publish
jbPublishMavencentraldemo - Publish module 'mavencentraldemo' to all targeted repositories
jbPublishMavencentraldemoToMavenCentral - Publish module 'mavencentraldemo' to Maven Central
jbPublishMavencentraldemoToMavenLocal - Publish module 'mavencentraldemo' to Maven Local repository
jbPublishMavencentraldemoToMavenRepositories - Publish module 'mavencentraldemo' to all Maven repositories
jbPublishToMavenCentral - Publish to Maven Central
jbPublishToMavenLocal - Publish to Maven Local repository
jbPublishToMavenRepositories - Publish to all Maven repositories
```

The task `jbPublish` publishes component to all specified repositories, which is MavenLocal and MavenCentral for this sample. We may use `jbPublishToMavenCentral`  to publish our component to the Maven Central repository only.

After published the component to Maven Central successfully, we need to [release](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-guide/#releasing-to-central) the component manually at the OSSRH website.
