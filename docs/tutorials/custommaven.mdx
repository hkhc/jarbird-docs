In this tutorial we will go through the process of publishing to a custom 
maven repository.

The sample project is [here](https://github.com/hkhc/jarbird-samples/tree/master/custommaven).

You need access to your own repository manager server. For learning purpose you 
may [setup](#reposilite) a simple repository manager server on your local 
computer to try. There are a lot of open source and commercial [solutions](https://maven.apache.org/repository-management.html) for 
that, pick one you like.

## Project setup

### gradle.properties

Add maven server information to `gradle.properties`. We can have multiple maven 
server settings in one `gradle.properties` file. Each of the settings is 
identified by an ID. ("demo" in the example below.). 

```properties title="~/.gradle/gradle.properties"
# ...
repository.maven.demo.release=http://localhost
repository.maven.demo.snapshot=http://localhost
repository.maven.demo.username=writeuser
repository.maven.demo.password=....token....
# The following line is needed only if release or snapshot URL are HTTP.
repository.maven.demo.allowInsecureProtocol=true
# ...
```

The last line is an opt-in step to allow Jarbird plugin to use insecure 
server, to allow release and snapshot URL to be HTTP rather than HTTPS.

If you are using Rosilite server as the [setup](#rosilite), fill in the 
token for user `writeuser` to `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`.

We need to provide a URL for release version of component, a URL for 
snapshot version of component, username and password of your account.

### build.gradle

Tell Jarbird plugin that we want to publish to a custom Maven repository. We 
specify the ID of our Maven repository setting in `gradle.properties`.

<!--tabs-->
# build.gradle
```groovy {5}
// ...
jarbird {
    pub {
        mavenRepo("demo")
    }
}
// ...
```
# build.gradle.kts
```kotlin {5}
// ...
jarbird {
    pub {
        mavenRepo("demo")
    }
}
// ...
```
<!--/tabs-->

`mavenLocal()` can be omitted if you are not going to publish to Maven Local repository.

### pom.yaml

Unlike MavenCentral, we may skip some details in pom.xml. Jarbird get all of 
those at the `pom.yaml` file:

``` yaml title="pom.yaml"
group: jarbirdsamples
artifactId: mevendemo
version: 1.0
packaging: jar

licenses:
  - name: Apache-2.0
    dist: repo

developers:
  - id: demo
    name: Jarbird Demo
    email: jarbird.demo@fake-email.com

scm:
  repoType: github.com
  repoName: demo/jarbird-samples/maven-demo

```

See TODO for more details about the content of `pom.yaml`.

Jarbird plugin read the file and create proper POM file for publishing automatically.

With this setup, we can see more tasks available with `./gradlew tasks`

```text
Jarbird publishing tasks
------------------------
jbPublish - Publish
jbPublishCustommaven - Publish module 'custommaven' to all targeted repositories
jbPublishCustommavenToMavenDemo - Publish module 'custommaven' to Maven repository 'demo'
jbPublishCustommavenToMavenLocal - Publish module 'custommaven' to Maven Local repository
jbPublishCustommavenToMavenRepository - Publish module 'custommaven' to all Maven repositories
jbPublishToMavenDemo - Publish to Maven repository 'demo'
jbPublishToMavenLocal - Publish to Maven Local repository
jbPublishToMavenRepository - Publish to all Maven repositories
```

The task `jbPublish` publishes component to all specified repositories,
which is MavenLocal and MavenCentral for this sample.
We may use `jbPublishToMavenDemo`  to publish all of our components to the 
"demo" Maven repository. 

If you are using Rosilite server locally, you can observe the publishing 
activities at the console window of Rosilite, and find the published files 
at `repositories`

### Appendix: Setup Reposilite server

[Reposilite](https://reposilite.com/) is a simple, open-source Maven 
repository manager server. It can be set up in minutes on your local 
computer, which is ideal to learn about how Jarbird works with custom Maven 
repositories.

Assumed that you have an ordinary JDK (8+) installed on your computer.

#### Download the binary

Download the jar [here](https://github.com/dzikoysk/reposilite/releases). At 
the time of writing, the latest version is 2.9.22. Create a directory 
locally, and place the jar file there.

#### Start server

Start the server with `java -jar rosilite-2.9.22.jar`

After it has finished start up, we may type command in the command shell 
window directly.

#### Create users and tokens

- Type `keygen / adminuser m`, note the token generated. If you missed that, 
  you may find it in the file `tokens.dat` in the same directory.
- Type `keygen / writeuser w`, note the token generated.   

#### Done!
