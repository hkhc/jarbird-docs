In this tutorial, we will go through the process of publishing to a custom
Artifactory repository.

The sample project is [here](https://github.com/hkhc/jarbird-samples/tree/master/artifactory).

You need access to your Artifactory server. For learning purpose you
may get an open-source version of [JFrog artifactory server](https://jfrog.com/open-source/) on your local computer to try.

## Project setup

### gradle.properties

Add Artifactory server information to `gradle.properties`. We can have multiple Artifactory server settings in one `gradle.properties` file. Each of the settings is identified by an ID. ("demo" in the example below.). However, we can only use one Artifactory repository for each sub-project.

```properties title="~/.gradle/gradle.properties"
# ...
repository.artifactory.demo.release=http://localhost
repository.artifactory.demo.snapshot=http://localhost
repository.artifactory.demo.repoKey=demo-repo
repository.artifactory.demo.username=writeuser
repository.artifactory.demo.password=....token....
# ...
```

We need to provide a URL for the release version of the component, a URL for the snapshot version of the component, username and password of your account, and the `repoKey` that represent a particular repository in the Artifactory server.

### build.gradle

Tell Jarbird plugin that we want to publish to a custom Artifactory repository. We specify the ID of our Artifactory repository setting in `gradle.properties`.

<!--tabs-->
# build.gradle
```groovy {4}
// ...
jarbird {
    pub {
        artifactory("demo")
    }
}
// ...
```
# build.gradle.kts
```kotlin {4}
// ...
jarbird {
    pub {
        artifactory("demo")
    }
}
// ...
```
<!--/tabs-->

See [reference](../reference/pom) for more details about the content of `pom.yaml`.

Jarbird plugin read the file and create a proper POM file for publishing automatically.

With this setup, we can see more tasks available with `./gradlew tasks`

```text
Jarbird publishing tasks
------------------------
jbPublish - Publish
jbPublishCustomartifactory - Publish module 'customartifactory' to all targeted repositories
jbPublishCustomartifactoryToMavenLocal - Publish module 'customartifactory' to Maven Local repository
jbPublishToArtifactory - Publish jarbirdsamples:customartifactory:1.0 to Artifactory.
jbPublishToMavenLocal - Publish to Maven Local repository
```

The task `jbPublish` publishes component to all specified repositories, which is MavenLocal and MavenCentral for this sample. We may use `jbPublishToArtifactory`  to publish all of our components to the "demo" Maven repository.
