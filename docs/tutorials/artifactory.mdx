In this tutorial we will go through the process of publishing to a custom 
Artifactory repository.

The sample project is [here](https://github.
com/hkhc/jarbird-samples/tree/master/artifactory).

You need access to your own Artifactory server. For learning purpose you 
may get an open source version of [JFrog artifactory server](https://jfrog.com/open-source/) 
on your local computer to try. 

## Project setup

### gradle.properties

Add Artifactory server information to `gradle.properties`. We can have multiple 
Artifactory server settings in one `gradle.properties` file. Each of the settings is 
identified by an ID. ("demo" in the example below.). 

```properties title="~/.gradle/gradle.properties"
# ...
repository.artifactory.demo.release=http://localhost
repository.artifactory.demo.snapshot=http://localhost
repository.artifactory.demo.repoKey=demo-repo
repository.artifactory.demo.username=writeuser
repository.artifactory.demo.password=....token....
# ...
```

We need to provide a URL for release version of component, a URL for 
snapshot version of component, username and password of your account, and 
the repoKey that represent a particular repository in the Artifactory server.

### build.gradle

Tell Jarbird plugin that we want to publish to a custom Artifactory repository.
We specify the ID of our Artifactory repository setting in `gradle.properties`.

<!--tabs-->
# build.gradle
```groovy {5}
// ...
jarbird {
    pub {
        artifactory("demo")
    }
}
// ...
```
# build.gradle.kts
```kotlin {5}
// ...
jarbird {
    pub {
        artifactory("demo")
    }
}
// ...
```
<!--/tabs-->

`mavenLocal()` can be omitted if you are not going to publish to Maven Local repository.

See [here](../reference/pom) for more details about the content of `pom.yaml`.

Jarbird plugin read the file and create proper POM file for publishing automatically.

With this setup, we can see more tasks available with `./gradlew tasks`

```text
Jarbird publishing tasks
------------------------
jbPublish - Publish
jbPublishCustomartifactory - Publish module 'customartifactory' to all targeted repositories
jbPublishCustomartifactoryToMavenLocal - Publish module 'customartifactory' to Maven Local repository
jbPublishToArtifactory - Publish jarbirdsamples:customartifactory:1.0 to Artifactory.
jbPublishToMavenLocal - Publish to Maven Local repository
```

The task `jbPublish` publishes component to all specified repositories,
which is MavenLocal and MavenCentral for this sample.
We may use `jbPublishToArtifactory`  to publish all of our components to the 
"demo" Maven repository.
