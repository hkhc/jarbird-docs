In this tutorial, we are going to publish Android AAR library to Maven Central.

The sample project is [here](https://github.
com/hkhc/jarbird-samples/tree/master/android).

Unlike publishing  conventional JAR libraries, we need to take care of the
**Build Types**, **Flavors**, and **Variants** of Android library projects.

A variant is a combination of a build type and a flavor, so that it may refer
to a combination of source set, resources, etc. For example, a typical Android project
may have build types `debug` and `release`, and flavors for `qa` and
`production`. Then we have four different variants:

- `qaDebug`
- `qaRelease`
- `productionDebug`
- `productionRelease`

(We could ignore some combinations that do not make sense for particular
project, please refer to `variantFilter` in [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants) for details)

Each of the variants creates a different library and can be published
(or not to be published) individually. Jarbird plugin supports configure
how each of these components is published.

The source code of this tutorial is in the `android` directory.

### pom.yaml

The `pom.yaml` file is not that different from conventional JAR publishing.
The only difference right now is the `packaging` line.

```yaml title="pom.yaml" {4}
group: jarbirdsamples
artifactId: simpleaar
version: 1.0
packaging: aar

licenses:
  - name: Apache-2.0
    dist: repo

developers:
  - id: demo
    name: Jarbird Demo
    email: jarbird.demo@fake-email.com

scm:
  repoType: github.com
  repoName: demo/jarbird-samples/android
```

### build.gradle

We have a different plugin ID for Android project:

<!--tabs-->
# build.gradle
```groovy {4}
plugins {
    id 'com.android.library'
    id 'kotlin-android'
    id 'io.hkhc.jarbird-android' version "{{ jarbirdVersion }}"
}
```
# build.gradle.kts
```kotlin {4}
plugins {
    id("com.android.library")
    id("kotlin-android")
    id("io.hkhc.jarbird-android") version "{{ jarbirdVersion }}"
}
```
<!--/tabs-->

There is no new syntax and functions in the plugin `io.hkhc.jarbird-android`.
It just has additional capability to recognize Android `LibraryVariant` objects.
It does not hurt to use this plugin on conventional JAR projects. Just looks confusing.

The build script of typical Android library projects has an android block
to configure the build types and flavors. We add our code after the
`android` block to specify how they are published, in the Jarbird way.

<!--tabs-->
# build.gradle
```groovy {4,8}
// after android {}
android.libraryVariants.configureEach { variant ->
    jarbird {
        pub(variant.name) {
            mavenCentral()
            from(variant)
        }
    }
}
```
# build.gradle.kts
```kotlin {4,8}
// after android {}
android.libraryVariants.configureEach {
    jarbird {
        pub(name) {
            mavenCentral()
            from(this@configureEach)
        }
    }
}
```
<!--/tabs-->

Note how Kotlin and Groovy differ in getting the proper reference to the `from()`
method. Because of the `configureEach` loop, we created two `pub`s, one for
each variant, and the results are two sets of artefacts.

There are two things in the "jarbird" block that differs from our previous tutorials.
First the additional `from()` block that we have mentioned. When building
conventional JAR libraries, we normally don't need to specify where the source
code comes from. The plugin will figure it out by itself. When publishing Android
AAR components, we need to tell what to publish by passing the `LibraryVariant`
reference to `from()` method.

The other thing to notice is that we provided a name to `pub`.
It is used to identify them when there are multiple `pub`.
It could be any string as long as it is unique among `pub`s. Conventionally we
use the variant name of the Android project.

Normally Android library has at least two build types, `debug` and `release`.

## Run It

Executing `./gradlew jbPublishToMavenLocal` we get two publications:

- `~/.m2/repository/jarbirdsamples/simpleaar/1.0-release`
- `~/.m2/repository/jarbirdsamples/simpleaar/1.0-debug`

The artifacts will look like:

```shell-session
ls -1 ~/.m2/repository/jarbirdsamples/simpleaar/1.0-release
simpleaar-1.0-release-javadoc.jar
simpleaar-1.0-release-javadoc.jar.asc
simpleaar-1.0-release-sources.jar
simpleaar-1.0-release-sources.jar.asc
simpleaar-1.0-release.aar
simpleaar-1.0-release.aar.asc
simpleaar-1.0-release.module
simpleaar-1.0-release.module.asc
simpleaar-1.0-release.pom
simpleaar-1.0-release.pom.asc
```

This is the default way to distinguish different publications, that the version
is suffixed by the variant. However, we can change that.

## Variant with artifactId

We may make the variant part of the artifactId. We add one line to the Jarbird configuration:

<!--tabs-->
# build.gradle
```groovy {6}
android.libraryVariants.configureEach { variant ->
    jarbird {
        pub(variant.name) {
            mavenCentral()
            variantWithArtifactId()
            from(variant)
        }
    }
}
```
# build.gradle.kts
```kotlin {6}
android.libraryVariants.configureEach {
    jarbird {
        pub(name) {
            mavenCentral()
            variantWithArtifactId()
            from(this@configureEach)
        }
    }
}
```
<!--/tabs-->

The additional line indicates the artifactId shall be suffixed by the variant.
After executing `jbPublishToMavenLocal`, we get two publications with
directories like this:

- `~/.m2/repository/jarbirdsamples/simpleaar-release/1.0`
- `~/.m2/repository/jarbirdsamples/simpleaar-debug/1.0`

We could have even greater control to the coordinate of components by specifying variant in `pom.yaml`

## Variant with POM

We may customize the POM information for each variant in `pom.xml`. There
are two ways to do so. In this tutorial, we will focus on the one method first.

Let's change the `pom.yaml` like this:

```yaml title="pom.yaml" {1-6}
variant: debug
artifactId: simpleaar-staging
---
variant: release
artifactId: simpleaar-production
---
group: jarbirdsamples
version: 1.0
packaging: aar

licenses:
  - name: Apache-2.0
    dist: repo

developers:
  - id: demo
    name: Jarbird Demo
    email: jarbird.demo@fake-email.com

scm:
  repoType: github.com
  repoName: demo/jarbird-samples/android
```

Now our `pom.yaml` has three sections, two of them have a `variant` attribute.
When publishing components, Jarbird plugin **combine the section in `pom.yaml`
with `variant` attribute and the section without `variant`.** Therefore
effectively we have different `pom.yaml` for each of the variants.

Then we add a line to the `build.gradle` file.

<!--tabs-->
# build.gradle
```groovy {6}
android.libraryVariants.configureEach { variant ->
    jarbird {
        pub(variant.name) {
            mavenCentral()
            variantInvisible()
            from(variant)
        }
    }
}
```
# build.gradle.kts
```kotlin {6}
android.libraryVariants.configureEach {
    jarbird {
        pub(name) {
            mavenCentral()
            variantInvisible()
            from(this@configureEach)
        }
    }
}
```
<!--/tabs-->

The line `variantInvisible()` tell Jarbird plugin not to merge the variant name.
So the information of components we built is entirely on `pom.yaml`.

Executing `./gradlew jbPublishToMavenLocal` and we will get the following in
Maven Local repository:

- `~/.m2/repository/jarbirdsamples/simpleaar-production/1.0`
- `~/.m2/repository/jarbirdsamples/simpleaar-staging/1.0`

The artifacts of the release variant look like this:

```shell-session
$ ls -1 ~/.m2/repository/jarbirdsamples/simpleaar-production/1.0
simpleaar-production-1.0-javadoc.jar
simpleaar-production-1.0-javadoc.jar.asc
simpleaar-production-1.0-sources.jar
simpleaar-production-1.0-sources.jar.asc
simpleaar-production-1.0.aar
simpleaar-production-1.0.aar.asc
simpleaar-production-1.0.module
simpleaar-production-1.0.module.asc
simpleaar-production-1.0.pom
simpleaar-production-1.0.pom.asc
```
