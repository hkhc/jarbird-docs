We have built different types of libraries with Gradle. This time we are going to build Gradle Plugin with Jarbird.

The sample project is [here](https://github.com/hkhc/jarbird-samples/tree/master/gradleplugin)

From the perspective of the build script with Jarbird, building Gradle Plugin is the same as building conventional JAR libraries. All additional things are in the `pom.yaml`

Please refer to the `gradleplugin` project in the `jarbirdsamples` GitHub repo.

Note that if we publish Gradle Plugin in the old way, that no plugin ID is defined, we don't need any special means to publish it. It is just a conventional JAR library. In this section, we focus on publishing a new style Gradle Plugin that has a plugin ID.

## Gradle Portal account

An account is needed to publish to [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/).

## pom.yaml

Beside the usual information, we added one more section for Gradle plugin:

```yaml title="pom.yaml" {6-11}
group: jarbirdsamples
artifactId: gradleplugin
version: 1.0
packaging: jar
# ...the rest of pom.yml
plugin:
  id: jarbirdsamples.plugin
  displayName: Demo of simple Gradle Plugin
  implementationClass: simplelib.SimplePlugin
  tags:
    - publish
```

From the perspective of the remote repository, a Gradle plugin consists of two parts.

One is the JAR library that contains the Gradle plugin code(`jarbirdsamples:gradleplugin:1.0` in this example). It is published just like any other JAR libraries. The other part is the so-called "Plugin Marker Publication", which relate the plugin ID used in the new style `plugins` block in the build script, to the JAR library of the plugin itself.

Define the plugin ID as above (`jarbirdsamples.plugin`), and the implementation class of the plugin (`simplelib.SimplePlugin`). Then we can build the plugin as usual with `./gradlew jbPublishToMavenLocal`.

## build.gradle

To make it easier to use Gradle Plugin, we usually publish it to Gradle Plugin Portal. It is essentially a Maven repository that Gradle uses first to find a plugin. So we don't need to configure the repository in `pluginManagement` of `settings.gradle` to make the plugin accessible.

<!--tabs-->
# build.gradle
```groovy {5}
// ...
jarbird {
    pub {
        gradlePortal()
    }
}
// ...
```
# build.gradle.kts
```kotlin {5}
// ...
jarbird {
    pub {
        gradlePortal()
    }
}
// ...
```
<!--/tabs-->

So we can publish the Gradle Plugin to Maven Local or Gradle Portal by `jbPublishToMavenLocal` or `jbPublishToGradlePortal` respectively.

We can also publish Gradle Plugin to Maven Central by specifying `mavenCentral()` in the `pub` block.

If it is published to Maven Local repository, we may inspect the result. Two components are published, and they are at:

- `~/.m2/repository/jarbirdsamples/gradleplugin/1.0`
- `~/.m2/repository/jarbirdsamples/plugin/jarbirdsamples.plugin.gradle.
  plugin/1.0`

The latter is a so-called plugin marker publication that is used by Gradle to identify plugin by plugin ID. `jarbirdsamples.plugin` is the plugin ID.
