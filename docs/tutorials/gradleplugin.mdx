We have build different type of libraries with Gradle. This time we are going
to build Gradle Plugin wirth Jarbird.

The sample project is [here](https://github.
com/hkhc/jarbird-samples/tree/master/gradleplugin)

From build script perspective, building Gradle Plugin basically the same as building
conventional JAR libraries. All additional things are in the `pom.yaml`

Please refer to the `gradleplugin` project in the `jarbirdsamples` GitHub repo.

Note that if we publish Gradle Plugin in old way, that no plugin ID is defined,
we don't need any special means to publish it. It is just a conventional JAR
library. In this section we focus on publishing new style Gradle Plugin that
have plugin ID.

## Gradle Portal account

An account is needed to publish to [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/).

## pom.yaml

Beside the usual information, we added one more section for Gradle plugin:

```yaml title="pom.yaml" {6-11}
group: jarbirdsamples
artifactId: gradleplugin
version: 1.0
packaging: jar
# ...the rest of pom.yml
plugin:
  id: jarbirdsamples.plugin
  displayName: Demo of simple Gradle Plugin
  implementationClass: simplelib.SimplePlugin
  tags:
    - publish
```

From remote repository perspective, a Gradle plugin consists of two
parts. 

One is the JAR library that contains the Gradle plugin code 
(`jarbirdsamples:gradleplugin:1.0` in this example).
It is published just like any other JAR libraries. The other part is the
so-called "Plugin Marker Publication", that relate the plugin ID used in the
new style `plugins` block in build script, to the JAR library of the plugin itself.

So define the plugin ID as above (`jarbirdsamples.plug`), and the implementation
class of the plugin (`simplelib.SimplePlugin`). Then we can build the plugin
as usual with `./gradlew jbPublishToMavenLocal`.

## build.gradle

To make it easier to use Gradle Plugin, we usually publish it to Gradle Plugin
Portal. It is essentially a Maven repository that Gradle use it first to find
plugin. So we don't need to configure repository in `pluginManagement` of
`settings.gradle` to make the plugin accessible.

<!--tabs-->
# Groovy
```groovy title="build.gradle" {5}
// ...
jarbird {
    pub {
        mavenLocal()
        gradlePortal()
        useGpg = true
    }
}
// ...
```
# Kotlin
```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts" {5}
// ...
jarbird {
    pub {
        mavenLocal()
        gradlePortal()
        useGpg = true
    }
}
// ...
```
<!--/tabs-->

So we can publish the Gradle Plugin to Maven Local or Gradle Portal by
`jbPublishToMavenLocal` or `jbPublishToGradlePortal` respectively. 

We can also publish Gradle Plugin to Maven Central by specifying 
`mavenCentral()` in `pub` block.

If it is published to Maven Local repository, we may inspect the result. Two
components are published, and they are at:

- `~/.m2/repository/jarbirdsamples/gradleplugin/1.0`
- `~/.m2/repository/jarbirdsamples/plugin/jarbirdsamples.plugin.gradle.
plugin/1.0`

The latter is so-called plugin marker publication that is used by Gradle to
identify plugin by plugin ID. `jarbirdsamples.plugin` is the plugin ID.
