There are some special limitations to specific type of repositories

## Artifactory

- In one project or sub-project, we can have one artifactory server setting 
  only. 
- In one project or sub-project, we cannot have multiple pub that mix 
  snapshot and release version. Either all of them are release or all of 
  them are in snapshot.
